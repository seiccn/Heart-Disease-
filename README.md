# Solar Power Generation Data Analysis

This project explores the behavior of solar power plants through data generated by photovoltaic modules. The analysis includes the examination of DC and AC power, irradiation, ambient and module temperature, yield, correlation of features, and a comparison of two power plants.

## Data

The project uses solar power generation data and weather sensor data. The data files are available in the "/kaggle/input/solar-power-generation-data/" directory.

## Code Organization

- `main.py`: Main script for running the analysis.
- `data_loading.py`: Script for loading and preprocessing data.
- `visualization.py`: Script for visualization functions.
- Other necessary files and dependencies.


- PV system is a power system designed to supply usable solar power by means of photovoltaics.

- PV Cell is an electrical device that converts the energy of light directly into electricity by the photovoltaic effect, which is a physical and chemical phenomenon. It is also the basics photovoltaic device that is the building block PV modules.

- Photovoltaic effect is the generation of voltage and electric current in a material upon exposure to light.

- PV module is a group of PV cell connected in serie and/or parallel and encapsulated in an environmentally protective laminate.

- PV panel is a group of modules that is the basic building block of a PV array.

- PV array is a group of panels that comprises the complete PV generating unit.

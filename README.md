# Solar Power Generation Data Analysis

This project explores the behavior of solar power plants through data generated by photovoltaic modules. The analysis includes the examination of DC and AC power, irradiation, ambient and module temperature, yield, correlation of features, and a comparison of two power plants.

## Data

The project uses solar power generation data and weather sensor data. The data files are available in the "/kaggle/input/solar-power-generation-data/" directory.

## Code Organization

- `main.py`: Main script for running the analysis.
- `data_loading.py`: Script for loading and preprocessing data.
- `visualization.py`: Script for visualization functions.
- Other necessary files and dependencies.
